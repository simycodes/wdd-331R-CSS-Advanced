                    <h2>CSS Shapes</h2>

                    <!-- sub topic goes here -->
                    <article>
                      <h3><em>Shapes</em></h3>
                        <p> 
                            CSS is capable of making all sorts of shapes. Squares and rectangles are easy, 
                            as they are the natural shapes of the web. 
                            We also get the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS, which give us the 
                            potential of two more shapes we can add to the original element. 
                            By getting clever with positioning, transforming, and many other tricks, 
                            we can make lots of shapes in CSS with only a single HTML element.
                        </p>

                        <h4>border-radius for shapes</h4>
                        <p>
                            The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer border 
                            edge. You can set a single radius to make circular corners, or
                            <b>two radii to make elliptical corners.</b>
                            For elliptical corners there are 2 parameters to the border radius declaration. 
                            That is: param 1: The horizontal radius. param 2: the vertical radius.
                        </p>
                    </article>

                    <article>
                        <h3><em>Gradients</em></h3>
                        <p>
                            A gradient is an image and can be used anywhere images can be used, but it's 
                            created with CSS and is made up with colors, numbers and angles. CSS gradients 
                            allow you to create anything from a smooth gradient between two colors, right
                            up to impressive artwork by mixing and repeating multiple gradients.
                            <b>A gradient is set as a value to the background property</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CSS gradients are typically one color that fades into another, but CSS allows you to
                             control every aspect of how that happens, from the direction and the shape to the 
                             colors and how they transition from one to another.
                        </p>

                        <h4>linear-gradient function()</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>
                                The linear-gradient() function generates an image of two or more colors,
                                 progressively. It takes multiple arguments, but in its simplest configuration,
                                you can pass 2 colors as shown below <br>
                                .my-element { background: linear-gradient(black, white); }
                            </b>
                            It's called “linear” because the colors flow from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or at any angle you chose in a single direction.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can add as many colors and color stops as you like in a linear-gradient(),
                             and you can layer gradients on top of each other by separating each gradient 
                             with a comma
                        </p>

                        <h4>radial-gradient() function</h4>
                        <p>
                            To create a gradient that radiates in a circular fashion, the radial-gradient()
                             function steps in to help. It's similar to linear-gradient(), but instead of 
                             specifying an angle, you optionally specify a position and ending shape.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you just specify colors, the radial-gradient() will auto-select the position as
                             center and select either a circle or ellipse, depending on the size of the box.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Conic gradient</h4>
                        <p>
                            A conic gradient is similar to a radial gradient. Both are circular and use the center
                             of the element as the source point for color stops. However, where the color stops 
                             of a radial gradient emerge from the center of the circle, a conic gradient places
                            them around the circle.
                        </p>
                        <p>A conic gradient has a center point in your box and starts from the top (by default), 
                            and goes around in a 360 degree circle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The conic-gradient() function accepts position and angle arguments.
                            By default, the angle is 0 degrees which starts at the top, in the center. 
                            If you were to set the angle to be 45deg, it would be the top right corner. 
                            The angle argument accepts any type of angle value, like the linear and radial 
                            gradients.The position is center by default. As with radial and linear gradients, positioning can be keyword-based, or it can be defined with numeric values.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If we do not specify an angle for the colors, then it is assumed that the gradient 
                            is evenly divided between the colors, starting at 0deg and ending at 360deg. That 
                            creates a “hard stop” where the colors bump right up to one another at 0deg and 
                            360deg. If we introduce a third value, then that creates a smoother gradient and
                            we start to get that cool cone-looking perspective.
                        </p>
