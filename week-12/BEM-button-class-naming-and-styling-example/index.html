        THE BLOCK: The sole root of the component / Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own
    </p>

    <p>
        Element: A component part of the Block / A part of a block that has no standalone meaning 
        and is semantically tied to its block.
        Elements are delimited with two (2) underscores (__) . 
        These can be placed on direct children or grand-children elements of the block
    </p>

    <p>
        Modifier: A variant or extension of the Block / A flag on a block or element. 
        Use them to change appearance or behavior.
        and Modifiers are delimited by two (2) hyphens (--)
    </p>

    <h2>BEM example</h2>
    <p>
        .person {} is the Block; it is the sole root of a discrete entity. <br>
        .person__head {} is an Element; it is a smaller part of the .person {} Block, placed on elements inside the element having the person {} class <br>
        .person--tall {} is a Modifier; it is a specific variant of the .person {} Block. It is placed as the second class on the same element where .person element is placed
