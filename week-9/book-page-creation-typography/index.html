                For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect amortization program
                and you want to install it on the workgroup server for other systems to remotely 
                mount and use. Because this is a third-party or custom application, the logical 
                place for it is in <span class="commands-and-paths">/usr/local/appname</span>, possibly with a link to the program binary
                in the <span class="commands-and-paths">/usr/local/bin</span> directory (because that's in the path).

                    If given a choice between putting the software package <span>bigprog</span> in the
                    <strong>/usr/local/<span>bigprog</span> </strong> section and the <strong>/opt/<span>bigprog</span> </strong> section, it's hard to choose. 
                    Read any relevant exam question closely--the main difference being that the <strong>/opt</strong> 
                    section is not considered to be sharable, whereas the <strong>/usr</strong> section is often shared
                    and mounted by client systems.

                A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands properly with 
                the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin, you'll be expected to know 
                how to create, delete, edit, set permissions on, display, move, copy, and 
                determine the type of files and programs.

                    You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of possibilities, 
                    type in appropriate strings in fill-in-the-blank boxes, and in general show that 
                    you've run the programs and utilities in question.

            <h2>Tips for working with Linux files</h2>
            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS background, a quick
                set of recommendations for the less-experienced can be of help here:
            </p>

            <div class="tips-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>&#10148; Hidden files aren't really hidden -</b> They just begin with a ., such as the
                        <span class="commands-and-paths">.bashrc</span> and <span class="commands-and-paths">.bash_profile</span> files. These are not viewable by normal users with conventional 
                        commands and switches and aren't deleted by commands such as  
                        <span class="commands-and-paths">rm -f *.*.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>&#10148; Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters -</b> The filenames 
                        <span class="commands-and-paths">this.is.a.long.file</span> and 
                        <span class="commands-and-paths">thisisalongfile</span> are perfectly reasonable and possible.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>&#10148; Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type -</b> Use an _ or a - instead of 
                        spaces because it's neater and easier than prefixing all spaces with a <span class="commands-and-paths">\</span>. 
                        (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a space prefixes with a 
                        backslash.)
