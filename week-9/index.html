                      <h3><em>Typography</em></h3>
                        <p>
                            Web typography is the art and technique of arranging type on a website.
                            It involves the design or composition of the letters and characters and their
                            arrangement, communication, visual identity, brand persona and usability etc.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                          Typography plays a fundamental role in web creation and includes branding, visual 
                          design, user experience, user interface, content strategy.
                        </p>

                            <li></li>
                            <li></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Generic font families</h4>
                        <p>
                          Generic font families: The typefaces and fonts we choose from each time we style the 
                          text on our websites can each be categorized under one of two major styles: serif,
                          sans-serif, or cursive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <b>i.Serif:</b> serif font families have decorative strokes or tails.
                            They are commonly used for lengthy bodies of text, such as books, newspapers, many magazines, etc. 
                            This is largely because serif typefaces are easily readable when written in small body copy sizes.
                            <br>
                            <b>Serif fonts are more popular for computer screens – such as websites, blogs, software</b> 
                            ,In these use-cases, sans serif fonts are used for display use, such as headings, subtitles,
                            button texts, etc., rather than for body texts.
                            <b>
                            Some of the most known Serif font families include: Times New Roman, Georgia, Palatino, Garamond,Playfair Display
                            As you may have already noticed, brands and professional businesses often use serifs
                            for their logo (and website) when they want to appear more reputable, established, 
                            formal, etc.
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>ii.Sans-serif</b>
                            Sans serif typefaces are those that don’t have extending features (serifs) at the 
                            end of their strokes. <br>
                            Some of the most widely used sans serif typefaces include: Avenir, Roboto, 
                            Open Sans, Source Sans Pro, Lato, Montserrat, Proxima Nova

                                Your brand voice is verbalized and visualized by arts and letters.
                                NOTE: Think carefully about your brand personality. What type of associations, values and adjectives do you want people to think of when seeing your website and brand assets?

                                <b>Decide Between Serif or Sans Serif</b>
                                This is the most basic and foundational selection process that you can make 
                                about your website fonts.
                                Serif fonts are mainly associated with “authoritative, professional brands.
                                Sans serifs are known to be the modern choice, associated with “cutting-edge 
                                design, commerce, and modernism’s attempt to break with the past”.
                                NOTE: Take a look at other websites in your industry or business vertical, and 
                                see which they most commonly use: serif or sans? This can give you an idea of 
                                what’s most fashionable among your niche, and which typeface would make most 
                                sense to your observers.

                                <b>See if Your Fonts Pair Well Together:</b> 
                                Pairing two different fonts, each one with its own style and uniqueness, can 
                                amplify the brand messaging you’re striving to convey.
                                Brand personalities are multi-faceted. So, by using two distinct fonts (and there 
                                are definitely plenty of web font choices), each with its own character and style,
                                 you’re illustrating the unique, dynamic experience that your brand represents.
                                NOTE: Test several font pairs to see which one you like best. It’s recommended to
                                decide on a primary font first and then explore options for a secondary font, and
                                choose your favorite pair. Expert tip: try not to exceed more than three fonts

                                <b>Be Mindful of Font Size, Font Weight, and Line Length</b>
                                NOTE:  The “ideal” line length for optimum readability in web typography is known to
                                range between 45 to 85 characters. 
                                If you find yourself struggling to keep your text within this range, explore 
                                different combinations of font size and weights, to see how they impact one 
                                another. A font size of 18px might exceed 85 characters on one line, but if you 
                                give the font a slightly smaller size or a slightly lighter weight, things could
                                work out in your favor.

                                Get into the headset of your website visitors and readers – which words do you
                                 want them to notice first, or even immediately? And more so, what is the most 
                                 sophisticated, visually-pleasing format to communicate those words in?

                                CSS stylesheets make it more likely for your design to appear exactly the way 
                                you intended it to — and won’t be affected by constraints like device 
                                compatibility and screen size, browser compatibility, fonts available on a 
                                device, and similar factors

                                NOTE: Stick to conventional font sizes when deciding how big or small your text elements should be.
                                As much as web creators thrive on creativity, the step of choosing font sizes isn’t a time to reinvent the wheel.

                        <h4>Readability</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>i.Text Alignment</b>
                            The way you decide to align your text (left, right, justified or centered) can
                             have a direct impact on your content’s readability and its visual hierarchy, 
                             which is why this is a design choice that requires a diligent thought process.
                             The virtue of text alignment, in this case, is all about readability: it 
                             anchors readers so that they know where each line will start and have an 
                             easier and quicker time reading text and spending time on page and on your 
                             site in general. <br><br>

                             <b>ii.Letter Spacing</b>
                             Letter-spacing, also known as “tracking”, is the adjustment of horizontal white 
                             space between letters in a word or in a block of text.
                             Designers will often increase white space between letters in order to improve the readability of the text.

                             <b>Line Spacing</b>
                             Line spacing is the term used to define the vertical space between two lines of text.
                             When line spacing is set in a way that makes a text readable, what this essentially 
                             means is that the reader’s eye has an easy time passing from one line of text to 
                             the next. 
                             <b>
                                The general rule of thumb is that line spacing that falls within the range of
                                 130%-150% is ideal for readability, with 140% being “the most quoted sweet 
                                 spot”. Anything below 100% is considered to be unreadable, as this 
                                 percentage means letters on adjacent lines can touch. Logically, the 
                                 decision for how big or small a text’s line spacing should be is subjective 
                                 to several factors: typeface, font size, font style, etc.

                             <b>iii.Line Length</b>
                             Line length is all about finding the “right” amount of characters on each line so that your text is as readable as can be — in other words, legibility.
                             <b>To avoid a situation of “too long” or “too short”, the recommended line length is between 45-85 characters per line.</b>

                        <h4>Whitespace and flow</h4>
                        <p>
                            Whitespace is the space between design elements.
                            The following elements make up whitespace: <br>
                            leading: this controlled by line-height in our css <br>
                            tight or loose type setting: would be controlled with word-spacing <br>
                            padding: the internal space on an element is controlled with padding <br>
                            margin: the external spacing of an element is margin <br>
                            letter spacing (kearning): letter-spacing

                        <h4>Font-Family(typeface), and font</h4>
                        <p>
                           The term typeface can also be referred to as a font family: a set of characters 
                           (letters of the alphabet) with the same design — of varying sizes and weight.
                            Typefaces shouldn’t be confused with fonts, as a font is a graphical representation
                            of the typeface’s text character. In essence, a typeface is a family of related
                             fonts (hence the term “font family”), while fonts refer to the weights, widths, 
                             and styles that are each a variation of that typeface.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example: Roboto is the name of a font family, which is a range of typefaces of
                            the same style, and each of those variations are considered individual fonts. 
                            Based on these nuances, we can now understand that Roboto Thin and Roboto Bold
                            are actually not the same font — they are two separate fonts, but are part of
                            the same (Roboto) font family.

                            Variable fonts are an evolution of the OpenType font specification that enables many 
                            different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file, rather than
                             having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style. They let you access 
                             all the variations contained in a given font file via CSS and a single @font-face 
                             reference
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The variable font format is an evolution of OpenType (the format we’ve all been 
                            using for years) that allows a single file to contain all of those previously 
                            separate files (style files) in a single, highly efficient one. 
                            The type designer can decide which axes to include, and define minimum and maximum values.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Variable fonts are font files that fit a range of styles inside one file, usually
                            in a way that allows the font user to select a style from a fluid range of styles.
                            These stylistic ranges are called variable axes, and can be parameters, like font
                            weight, font width, optical size, font slant, or more creative things.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>
                                On the web, that means we can load a single file and use CSS to set any axis, 
                                anywhere along the allowable range, without any artificial distortion by the
                                browser. Some fonts might only have one axis (weight being the most common),
                                and some may have more. A few are defined as ‘registered’ axes, which are the 
                                most common: width, weight, slant, italic, and optical size—but the format is
                                extensible expressly so that designers can define their own custom axes and
                                allow any sort of variation they want to create. Let’s see how that works 
                                on the desktop.
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Static fonts</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the past, a typeface would be produced as several individual fonts, and each font 
                            would represent one specific width/weight/style combination. So you would have separate
                            files for 'Roboto Regular', 'Roboto Bold', and 'Roboto Bold Italic' — meaning that you
                            could end up with 20 or 30 different font files to represent a complete typeface. <br>
                            In such a scenario, to use a typeface for typical use on a site for body copy you 
                            would need at least four files: regular, italic, bold, and bold italic. If you wanted
                            to add more weights, like a lighter one for captions or a heavier one for extra
                            emphasis, that would mean several more files. This results in more HTTP requests,
                            and more data being downloaded (usually around 20k or more per file).
                        </p>

                        <h4>Now Variable Fonts</h4>
                        <p>
                            With a variable font, all of those permutations can be contained in a single file. 
                            That file would be larger than a single font, but in most cases smaller or about the 
                            same size as the 4 you might load for body copy. <br> 
                            <b>
                                The advantage in choosing the variable
                                font is that you have access to the entire range of weights, widths, and styles 
                                available, rather than being constrained to only the few that you previously would 
                                have loaded separately.
                            </b>
                            This allows for common typographic techniques such as setting different size headings
                            in different weights for better readability at each size or using a slightly narrower
                            width for data-dense displays. For comparison, it is typical in a typographic system 
                            for a magazine to use 10–15 or more different weight and width combinations throughout
                            the publication — giving a much wider range of styles than currently typical on the
                             web (or indeed practical for performance reasons alone).
                        </p>

                        <h4>The 'variation axis' of variable fonts</h4>
                        <p>
                            The heart of the new variable fonts format is the concept of an axis of variation 
                            describing the allowable range of that particular aspect of the typeface design.
                            <b>
                                So the 'weight axis' describes how light or how bold the letterforms can be; 
                                the 'width axis' describes how narrow or how wide they can be; the 'italic axis' 
                                describes if italic letterforms are present and can be turned on or off 
                                accordingly, etc. Note that an axis can be a range or a binary choice. Weight 
                                might range from 1–999, whereas italic might be 0 or 1 (off or on).
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As defined in the specification, there are two kinds of axes: registered and custom: <br>
                            <b>
                                i.Registered axes are those that are most frequently encountered, and common enough 
                                that the authors of the specification felt it was worth standardizing.
                                The five currently registered axes are weight, width, slant, italic, and optical size.
                            </b> <br>
                            ii.Custom axes are limitless: the typeface designer can define and scope any axis they
                            like and are just required to give it a four-letter tag to identify it within the 
                            font file format itself. You can use these four-letter tags in CSS to specify a 
                            point along that axis of variation
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>NOTE: Registered axes and existing CSS attributes</b> <br>
                            The lower-level syntax (font-variation-settings) was the first mechanism implemented
                            to test the early implementations of variable font support. 
                            Wherever possible, the appropriate property should be used, with the lower-level 
                            syntax of font-variation-settings only being used to set values or axes not available
                            otherwise. 
                        </p>

                        <h4>Using the font-variation-settings property for variable fonts</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>When using font-variation-settings it is important to note that axis names are case-sensitive. 
                            The registered axis names must be in lower case, and custom axes must be in upper case.
                            </b>  <br>
                            For example: <b>font-variation-settings: "wght" 375, "GRAD" 88;</b> <br>
                            <b>wght (weight) is a registered axis, and GRAD (grade) is a custom one.</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>
                                If you have set values using font-variation-settings and want to change one of those 
                                values, you must redeclare all of them (in the same way as when you set OpenType font 
                                features using font-feature-settings). 
                            </b>
                            You can work around this limitation by using CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables) for
                             the individual values, and modifying the value of an individual custom property. 
                        </p>

                        <h4>Variable registered axis property names and their use</h4>
                        <p>
                            There are currently five standard axes a font can include: <br>
                            wght – Weight, to control lightness and boldness<br>
                            wdth – Width, to control overall letter width<br>
                            opsz – Optical Size, to control adjustments to design for better readability at various sizes<br>
                            ital – Italic, generally to switch between separate upright/italic designs<br>
                            slnt – Slant, generally to control upright-to-slanted designs with intermediate values available
                            <b>
                                Custom axes can be almost anything. Recursive includes three of them — Monospace (MONO), Casual (CASL), and Cursive (CRSV)  — plus two standard axes, wght and slnt.

                            <li>
                                <b>Weight:</b>
                                Weight (represented by the wght tag) defines the design axis of how thin or thick 
                                (light or heavy, in typical typographic terms) the strokes of the letterforms can be.
                                Any number from 1 to 1000 is valid.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Width: </b>
                                Width (represented by the wdth tag) defines the design axis of how narrow or wide 
                                (condensed or extended, in typographic terms) the letterforms can be. This is 
                                typically set in CSS using the font-stretch property, with values expressed as
                                 a percentage above or below 'normal' (100%). <b>Note: The % symbol is not used when utilizing font-variation-settings.</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Italic: </b>
                                The Italic (ital) axis works differently in that it is either on or off; there is no
                                in-between. Italic designs often include dramatically different letterforms from 
                                their upright counterparts, so in the transition from upright to italic, several
                                glyph (or character) substitutions usually occur. Italic and oblique are often
                                used somewhat interchangeably, but in truth are quite different. Oblique is 
                                defined in this context with the term slant (see the below section), and a 
                                typeface would typically have one or the other, but not both.
                                In CSS, both italic and oblique are applied to text using the font-style property. 
                                Also note the introduction of font-synthesis: none; — which will prevent browsers 
                                from accidentally applying the variation axis and a synthesized italic. This can be 
                                used to prevent faux-bolding as well.
                            </li>

                                <b>Slant</b>
                                Slant (represented by the slnt tag), or as it's often referred to, 'oblique' — is 
                                different from true italics in that it changes the angle of the letterforms but 
                                doesn't perform any kind of character substitution. It is also variable, in that 
                                it is expressed as a numeric range. This allows the font to be varied anywhere 
                                along that axis. The allowed range is generally 0 (upright) to 20 degrees.

                                <b>Optical size</b>
                                Optical sizing refers to the practice of varying the overall stroke thickness of 
                                letterforms based on physical size. If the size was very small (such as an equivalent
                                to 10 or 12px), the characters would have an overall thicker stroke, and perhaps
                                other small modifications to ensure that it would reproduce and be readable at a 
                                physically smaller size. Conversely, when a much larger size was being used
                                (like 48 or 60px), there might be much greater variation in thick and thin stroke
                                weights, showing the typeface design more in line with the original intent.
                                <b>
                                    There is a new attribute, font-optical-sizing, created to support variable fonts in
                                    CSS. When using font-optical-sizing, the only allowed values are auto or none — so 
                                    this attribute only allows for turning optical sizing on or off. However when using 
                                    font-variation-settings: 'opsz' -num-, you can supply a numeric value

                                The term 'grade' refers to the relative weight or density of the typeface design, 
                                but differs from traditional 'weight' in that the physical space the text occupies
                                does not change, so changing the text grade doesn't change the overall layout of 
                                the text or elements around it. 
                                <b> This makes grade a useful axis of variation as it can be varied or animated without causing a reflow of the text itself.</b>

                        <p>
                            The main difference between these two terms is that a typeface (or type family) 
                            is the name of a specific collection of related fonts. In comparison, font 
                            refers to a particular weight, width, and style within that typeface. To put it 
                            in simple terms, each variation of a typeface is a font. <br>

                                Typeface/font-family is a group of related fonts and a font is a type of
                                a typeface/font-family with a different style, weight and width.
                            </b>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Using a variable font: @font-face changes</h4>
                        <p>
                            The syntax for loading variable fonts is very similar to any other web font, 
                            with a few notable differences.
                            <b>
                                The basic syntax is the same, but the font technology can be specified, and 
                                allowable ranges for descriptors like font-weight and font-stretch can be 
                                supplied, rather than named according to the font file being loaded.
                            </b>
                            Note: Supplying value ranges for font-weight, font-stretch, and font-style will keep 
                            the browser from attempting to render an axis outside that range if you are using the
                            appropriate attribute (i.e. font-weight or font-stretch), but will not block you from
                            supplying an invalid value via font-variation-settings, so use with care.
                        </p>
